# USBKey (Mac OSX Version)

The Mac version of USBKey system. Where the `listenUsb.swift` script should be installed to run when login to your mac. The script would listen for an insert of usb device "Cruzer Fit" where it that type of device is interted and device parition is called disk2s1 or disk3s1 and so on, then the ls command should be shown. The osx-usbkey-ctl will eventually be used to watch for inserts and removes of usb where keys will be place to be used for ssh to secure servers.
